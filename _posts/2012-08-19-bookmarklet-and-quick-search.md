A bookmarklet for saving links to Linktuned has been created. It enables you to save a link to Linktuned without visiting our website. Now, when you are reading some interesting link, you can save it with a single click.

Also, Linktuned allows you to add it as a search engine to Firefox's Search Bar. After choosing Linktuned as the search engine, you can search your links in Firefox directly, without going to your Linktuned home page.

Please follow the instructions on [Tools](http://www.linktuned.com/tools) page.
