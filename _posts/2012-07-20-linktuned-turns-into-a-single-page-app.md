title: Linktuned turns into a single web page app
---

We have finished the re-design of the GUI recently, to make linktuned into a single web page app. After signed in, any operation keeps on the same page, including adding channels and searching. No page refresh anymore. Data is fetched from server asynchronously and most page content is generated on client side. The new page is more responsive, though the GUI doesn't change a lot.

Thanks for the great [backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) project and its greate community, which makes this process really easy.

Enjoy it~
