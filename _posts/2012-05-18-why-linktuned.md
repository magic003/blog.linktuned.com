title: Why Linktuned
---

This is a long story dated back to December 2010, about one and a half years ago.

At that time, I was using 3 online services to save my links: [delicious](http://delicious.com), [twitter](http://twitter.com) and [readitlater](http://getpocket.com). I used [delicious](http://delicious.com) to save bookmarks in the old days, used [twitter](http://twitter.com) to share interesting things with friends, and recently used [readitlater](http://getpocket.com) to save links for most time, because it is really convenient. However, the problem comes when I want to find back some links. I cannot remember where I saved the links. I also hate tags, because I may use different tags even for the same concept. So I have to go through most links to get the one I want. What I need is a tool that can find back my links easily just with a few keywords. 

I searched on the internet, but didn't find such a service. So I was eager to create such a web site that automatically collects links from various sources and provides a full-text search engine for them. However, after I talked to some friends, almost all the feedback from them was negative. Someone said he didn't have such a requirement and he wouldn't use it. Someone said you could write it for your interest but it wouldn't be a big deal. I was really frustrated.

Almost at the same time, [Yahoo said Delicious will be sold](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/now_yahoo_says_delicious_will_live_onsomewhere_els.php). And two days later, I read an [article](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/trunkly_adds_search_and_curation_to_social_bookmarking.php) about Trunkly. It is a web site that did exactly what I was thinking(Though my further plan was different from it). It was really a prototype at that time, and it even didn't deal very well with Chinese.

I don't like to reinvite the wheel. Also I was busy with some personal affairs, so I gave up.

When I almost forgot this, I was shocked by a news in a morning nearly one year later. [Trunkly was acquired by Delicious](http://blog.trunk.ly/2011/11/10/avos-acquires-trunkly/). At least, this proved my initial idea was not that bad. The web site would be shut down in several months. This time, I could not wait to do it myself anymore. So I found Andox, and told him "Let's write a tool just for ourselves, even if there is nobody cares about it". Four months later, we have Steven joined us.

Fundamentally, I have the same point of view as Trunkly. When surfing the internet, if the user feels something is interesting, she will retweet it using twitter or save it for future using readitlater. So the link-save service is no longer URL copy-and-save. It happens naturally during the daily internet usage. It is not a replacement of the existing link-save or social services. It should not affect the current user habit. It just collects links sliently from various sources and you can find it back by a single click. This is the essential goal. So I call it [Linktuned](http://www.linktuned.com), which always stays tuned to your links.

I do have some different opinion with Trunkly. I am not going to add friend relationship in [Linktuned](http://www.linktuned.com), at least in the near future. Friendship is used to better share links or information, because we assume friends may have common interests. In my opinion, links is already a good resource to identify a user's characteristics or interests, and also user already forms a social network on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) or [Facebook](http://facebook.com), there is no need to form another one here.

[Linktuned](http://www.linktuned.com) is not just going to be simple link-save service. We do have some ambitious plans. Links are kind of assets or talent for users, so we can use it to help them find much more valuable information. This is really a long plan. Before that, we will focus on our current goal.

We are very glad to bring up this web site to you very soon. Hopefully, it will be helpful.
