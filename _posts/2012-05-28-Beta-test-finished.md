title: Beta test finished
---

We finished the first round Beta test in the past a few days. We picked a limited number of friends, who we thought might be potential users, to take part in the test. We do receive a lot of great feedback and suggestions from them. Many suggestions about the usability were raised, and some critical functional issues were found too. So I'd like to take this chance to thank everyone who contributed on this test. We treat your requirement and advice seriously.

We are trying our best to improve the usability of Linktuned now. I believe it will be available next week.
