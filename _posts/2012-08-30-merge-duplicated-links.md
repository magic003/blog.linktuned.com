title: Merge duplicated links
---

During our daily usage of Linktuned, we find there are some links with the same URL are saved multiple times in different contexts, such as from different channels or with different notes. Linktuned treats them as different links and saves separately. We do not want to lose the note information, because it is a key factor for searching. However, this results in duplications in "My Links" and search results.

We did a small change today, and the links with same URL were merged to one link, with all notes retained. From now on, the same links will be displayed only once.

After this merge, your link count will probably be reduced. Don't be surprised. :)
