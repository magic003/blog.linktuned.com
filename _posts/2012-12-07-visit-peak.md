title: Visit Peak and System Upgrade
---

In the past two weeks, our website reached a visit peak since it was launched 5 months ago. We got more than 300 PV and 120 unique visits for a single day. The reason is Linktuned was referred by two articles: [makeuseof](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/cool-websites-and-tools-november-24th-2012/) and [wnd](http://www.wnd.com/2012/11/we-dont-need-a-warrant-were-the-government/).

Moreover, we got about 160 new signups, several new Facebook likes, and some feature requests as well. This peak made our server run short of memory very quickly and our crawler was killed by the system due to out of memory frequently. To improve the usability, we have upgraded the server today, by adding more memory.

Dear users, we are eager to hear your feedbacks. This will definitely help us improve Linktuned.
