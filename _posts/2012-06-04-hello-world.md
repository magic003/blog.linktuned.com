Hello and welcome to Linktuned!

Internet is changing a lot. In the past, you use Delicious to save and find useful links. Now, you use readitlater to save links for future read with a single click, you tag a tweet as favorite in Twitter, you also like a link in Facebook. There are so many links and web pages you read and share everyday. Later, it is really difficult to remember exactly where and when you met a link.

Linktuned automatically collects links from various sources for you, and provides powerful search, with only a few keywords. With Linktuned, you don't need to read through dozens of links in various websites. They are all in one place, and you can find one easily using the search. We start with four link sources, Delicous, Readitlater, Twitter and Facebook, and more will be added in the future.

It is built by Diego, Steven and Andox, from our own requirements. We like to build tools that make our Internet life easier.

What's next? We are working hard to improve the GUI and usability now. Subscribe to our [blog](http://blog.linktuned.com), or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linktuned).
